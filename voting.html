                <p>Since its founding, the United States has used the Electoral College to elect the nation's president. A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win the White House. </p><br>

                <p>Five presidents in the history of the nation won the presidency without winning the popular vote â€” most recently, Donald Trump in 2016. His opponent that year, Hillary Clinton, won over 2.8 million more votes than Trump nationwide, but she lost enough key states to be defeated in the Electoral College, 306 to 232. </p><br>

                <p>In 2020, Trump lost both the popular vote and the Electoral College to Joe Biden. The electoral vote was 306 to 232, but in the Democrat's favor.</p>
